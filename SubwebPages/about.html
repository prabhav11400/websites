            TEDx is a unique gathering where TED-like talks and performances are shared with the community aimed at unleashing new ideas and inspirations.
            Some of the world's leading thinkers, who have dreamt of game-changing ideas, are invited to share their stories.
            The 'x' in TEDx stands for an independently organized TED event. It mainly comprises speakers who bring in thought-provoking ideas,
            complete with enough professionalism and zeal, to leave you with an impression of enough powerful ideas and insights. The speakers are mainly
            passionate individuals looking to spark discussions and conversations by bringing forward thoughts and research ideas in their areas of expertise.
